  abstract  = {In this paper we study the implication and the finite implication problems for data dependencies. When all dependencies are total the problems are equivalent and solvable but are NP-hard, i.e., probably computationally intractable. For non-total dependencies the implication problem is unsolvable, and the finite implication problem is not even partially solvable. Thus, there can be no formal system for finite implication. The meta decision problems of deciding for a given class of dependencies whether the implication problem is solvable or whether implication is equivalent to finite implication are also unsolvable.},

  abstract  = {The Guarded Negation Fragment (GNFO) is a fragment of first-order logic that contains all unions of conjunctive queries, a restricted form of negation that suffices for expressing some common uses of negation in SQL queries, and a large class of integrity constraints. At the same time, as was recently shown, the syntax of GNFO is restrictive enough so that static analysis problems such as query containment are still decidable. This suggests that, in spite of its expressive power, GNFO queries are amenable to novel optimizations. In this paper we provide further evidence for this, establishing that GNFO queries have distinctive features with respect to rewriting. Our results include effective preservation theorems for GNFO, Craig Interpolation and Beth Definability results, and the ability to express the certain answers of queries with respect to GNFO constraints within very restricted logics.},
